> As hackneyed and precious as it may be interpreted, we actually believe that records can be  powerful hoodoo totemistic and utilitarian objects that can further the development of culture, revolution and spirituality. They can be more than just cultural commodities.

### Why keep this repo public?

Besides being a staunch open-source advocate, it's important for me to keep a public-facing document of my progress with new (to me) technologies. It leads me to be more responsible with my development, and write cleaner code. Additionally, I aim to follow the [OWASP](https://www.owasp.org/) principal which encourages organizations to "[avoid security by obscurity](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Avoid_security_by_obscurity)".
